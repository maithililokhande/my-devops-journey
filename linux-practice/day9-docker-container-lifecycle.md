# Day 9 – Docker Container Lifecycle

- Docker containers follow a lifecycle: create, run, stop, delete
- `docker run` creates a new container
- `docker start` restarts an existing container
- `docker exec -it bash` is used to enter a running container
- `hostname` shows container identity
- Containers can be stopped and removed without deleting images
- Containers are treated like disposable servers
